This could potentially be supplemented with a further breakdown, for instance a further breakdown in terms of age brackets. Likely what gave females an advantage should also give children an advantage is they are prioritized on getting onto lifeboats. \n"

This likely indicates that they are prioritized when getting onto lifeboats, they may also be aware slightly earlier of the boat sinking. If the movie is to be believed, then those with better passenger classes likely also had better rooms that are closer to the service. Unsurprisingly, a variable that echos this is fare interval. those with the highest fare also had the highest survival rate."

However, the data does not reflect that, so we must model it carefully, but this actually makes sense and is aligned with out other hypotheses. Interval 0 unsurprisingly has quite a high survival rate, which largely reflects the hypothesis that children are given priority. Those that are older also had a fairly how survival rate, which shows they may have been given priority as well."
